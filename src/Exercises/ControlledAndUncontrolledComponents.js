      <h4>Controlled and uncontrolled components</h4>
      <p>
        Controlled components are the ones that their internal state is
        controlled by React.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        From the React docs: "In a controlled component, form data is handled by
        a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where
        form data is handled by the DOM itself."
      </p>
      <p>
        "With a controlled component, the inputâ€™s value is always driven by the
        React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can
        now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other
        event handlers."
      </p>
      <p>It is recommended to use Controlled Components</p>
      <h4>Controlled Component:</h4>
      <ControlledComponent />
      <h4>Uncontrolled Component:</h4>
      <UncontrolledComponent />
